# Trivia App

Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game, but their API experience is limited and still needs to be built out.

That's where you come in! Help them finish the trivia app so they can start holding trivia and seeing who's the most knowledgeable of the bunch. The application must:

1. Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
2. Delete questions.
3. Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4. Search for questions based on a text query string.
5. Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.

## Starting and Using the Project
### Requirement
You must have the following tools ready to run this project
- Python3
- Virtual Environment
- NodeJS

### Backend

Before you get started, set up your virtual environment

```
python -m virtualenv env
env/Scripts/activate
```
Once your virtual environment is setup and running, install the required dependencies by navigating to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##### Run the Server
From within the `./src` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run --reload
```

The `--reload` flag will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

### Frontend

The [frontend](./frontend/README.md) directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server. 

You will need to run 


```
$ npm install
```
This will install the frontend dependencies.

Finally, to get the frontend server running, execute
```
npm start
```
Goto http://localhost:3000 to view the page on the browser.

## API Reference

### Getting Started
- Base URL: At present this app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, which is set as a proxy in the frontend configuration. 


### Error Handling
Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```
{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 400,
    "message": "bad request"
}
```
The API will return three error types when requests fail:
- 400: Bad Request
- 404: Resource Not Found
- 422: Not Processable 
- 405: Method Not Allowed
- 500: Internal Server Error
